## Clone the plain inference repository

## Use the qsub (plaininference) included to run the mcmc.Rev script

This script will run for 24 hours at a time

Each day:

+ Open the file mcmc-test-stoch.log with vi. Type a capital G to jump to the end of the file. Is the number of generations 300,000?

If YES:
	+ Move the mcmc-test-stoch.log to be called the fileNumber.log. For example, if file 1.nex ran, call the file 1.nex.log
	+ Move the FILE.trees file to be called the fileNumber.trees. For example, if the file is 5.nex, call the trees file 5.nex.trees.
	+ Move the nexus file, the trees file and the log file into the results5 directory.

If NO:
	+ Open the mcmc.Rev file. Uncomment the lines that read in the trace, and initializes the MCMC from the trace (lines 25 and 26). This will restart the analysis where it left off.


+ Perform the above steps for each of the 20 directories for which you are responsible. So, you will look at 20 mcmc-test-stoch.log files. Then, use the qsub plainInference file to restart the analysis.

When the 50 trees for which you are responsible are done computing:

Each day:

+ Make 20 directories in the results directory. Move 2-3 trees files into each.
+ Check how many taxa are in your results. The smaller taxon set gets compared against big.tre,
the smaller against binsimtree.txt. You may need to edit this in the treeCompare.Rev script in the
results folder.
+ Qsub the treeCompare script.
+ Check the results/ subfolders. If there are still .trees files in them, re-submit the treeCompare script

When you have completed this:

Contact me for more work.

To copy more files for summary, you will first get them from the lab server. Talk to one another to decide
who will summarize what files. First get the location of the file that you will summarize:

```UNIX
ssh antlab0@<address I sent to you privately>
```

You will go into /media/antlab0/antlabSSD

Choose the file you would like to copy, and type "pwd" to get the path to it.

Now, exit the connection. Use secure copy to copy the tar.gz file to your work directory.

Unzip it, and move the .trees files into the 20 directories you had previously set up.
You will put 5 files into each dir. Rename the "analyzed" directory to indicate the what
file you are processing. For example, if you are processing bincat6, name it to be
analyzedBinCat6.
